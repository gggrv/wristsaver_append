## Contents

This repository contains a discarded experiment. I attempted to **repurpose as quickly as possible** pre-existing (and severely suboptimal) architecture from an [unrelated project](https://github.com/gggrv/edu_archive_dust_v5). Two outcomes were possible:
1. **Experience** — an understanding of "what is ok" and "what is unusable" (for example).
2. **Product** — the actual GUI for modernized version of the project `wristsaver`.

This attempt resulted in **valuable experience** and **lack of any immediately usable product**.

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Status | ❌ Nonfunctional.<br>😴 Archived, outdated, no longer maintained.<br>😴 Throwaway. |
| Reasoning | ❌ Counter-intiutive interface design choices (navigating the interface requires trial and error + memorization).<br>❌ Class/datafolder hierarchy is hard to understand and has irrelevant overcomplicated features.<br>❌ Variable "namespaces" make the code editing process error-prone and slow.<br>✔️ GUI architecture **can** indeed be **reused very quickly**, but in the long-term it is much more beneficial to use something else entirely. |
